The Location Producer in modules has one method Create.

This endpoint allows a client to create new location messages.

To call the Create method run:

python modules/location-producer/writer.py

Please note that given this current architecture design - you must have:
 - the gRPC server running (main.py)
 - Kafka location topic created
 - zookeeper running
